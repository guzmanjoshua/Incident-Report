**Incident Description**

- This incident involves observation of potential brute force attempts against a Windows VM.

**KQL**

```
// Brute Force Success Windows
let FailedLogons = SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625 and LogonType == 3
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| summarize FailureCount = count() by AttackerIP = IpAddress, EventID, Activity, LogonType, DestinationHostName = Computer
| where FailureCount >= 5;
let SuccessfulLogons = SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4624 and LogonType == 3
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| summarize SuccessfulCount = count() by AttackerIP = IpAddress, LogonType, DestinationHostName = Computer, AuthenticationSuccessTime = TimeGenerated;
SuccessfulLogons
| join kind = inner FailedLogons on DestinationHostName, AttackerIP, LogonType
| project AuthenticationSuccessTime, AttackerIP, DestinationHostName, FailureCount, SuccessfulCount
```

**Initial Response Actions**

- Verify the authenticity of the alert or report.
- Immediately isolate the machine and change the password of the affected user
- Identify the origin of the attacks and determine if they are attacking or involved with anything else
- Determine how and when the attack occurred
    - Are the NSGs not being locked down? If so, check other NSGs
- Assess the potential impact of the incident.
    - What type of account was it? Permissions?
    

**Containment and Recovery**

- Lock down the NSG assigned to that VM/Subnet, either entirely, or to allow only necessary traffic
- Reset the affected userâ€™s password
- Enable MFA
